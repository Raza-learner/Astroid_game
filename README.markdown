# Asteroid Game

## Overview
Asteroid Game is a classic space-themed arcade game where players control a spaceship to navigate through an asteroid field, avoiding collisions and destroying asteroids to score points. This project is built using [programming language/framework, e.g., Python with Pygame], providing a fun and interactive gaming experience.

## Features
- **Player Controls**: Use keyboard inputs to move the spaceship and shoot projectiles.
- **Dynamic Asteroids**: Randomly generated asteroids with varying sizes and speeds.
- **Scoring System**: Earn points by destroying asteroids.
- **Game Over Conditions**: Collision with an asteroid ends the game.
- **Responsive Design**: Smooth gameplay with real-time collision detection.
